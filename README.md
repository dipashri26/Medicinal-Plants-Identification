# Medicinal-Plants-Identification
Machine Learning Project 
This project aims to build a deep learning model capable of identifying medicinal plants from 
images. By leveraging deep neural networks, the system can classify plants accurately, helping users 
identify plant species with medicinal value. 
Technology Stack: 
1. Deep Learning Framework: 
o ResNet-50: 
▪ The project uses ResNet-50, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 
architecture, for image classification. ResNet-50 is known for its deep 
residual learning framework, which helps in training very deep networks by 
solving the vanishing gradient problem. 
2. Programming Languages & Libraries: 
o Python: 
▪ Python is the primary programming language, offering a rich ecosystem of 
libraries for machine learning and image processing. 
o TensorFlow & Keras: 
▪ TensorFlow is used for building and training the model. Keras (high-level API) 
is used on top of TensorFlow for easier model construction and 
experimentation. 
▪ Keras allows you to easily define deep learning models like ResNet-50 with 
minimal code. 
3. Image Processing Libraries: 
o OpenCV & PIL: 
▪ OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is used for image pre
processing tasks like resizing, normalization, and data augmentation. 
▪ PIL (Python Imaging Library) is used for basic image operations such as 
loading, cropping, and adjusting images. 
4. Development & Deployment: 
o Jupyter Notebook: 
▪ Jupyter Notebook is used for code development, model training, and 
evaluation, providing an interactive environment for experimenting with 
different models and data processing techniques. 
How the System Works: 
1. Data Collection & Preprocessing: 
o A dataset of medicinal plant images is gathered and labeled for training. 
o The images are pre-processed using techniques like resizing, color normalization, and 
augmentation (rotation, flipping, etc.) to increase the robustness of the model. 
2. Model Architecture: 
o ResNet-50 is used for the classification task. The architecture contains 50 layers and 
employs residual connections, which help the network learn from deeper layers 
without degradation. 
o The model is fine-tuned for plant classification by adding a softmax layer at the 
output to classify images into various plant species. 
3. Training & Evaluation: 
o The model is trained using a dataset of labeled plant images. Data augmentation 
techniques are applied to improve the model’s generalization ability. 
o The model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall, ensuring it 
classifies plant species correctly. 
4. Model Deployment: 
o The trained model is deployed within a Jupyter Notebook, where users can upload 
images and get real-time predictions of the plant species. 
Key Features: 
1. Accurate Identification: 
o The deep learning model classifies plant species based on images, helping identify 
medicinal plants with high accuracy. 
2. Image Pre-processing: 
o Various pre-processing steps like resizing and normalization are used to improve the 
model’s performance. 
3. Interactive Platform: 
o The platform is built in Jupyter Notebook, which allows easy experimentation, 
model fine-tuning, and evaluation.
